The principles used may come from fundamental physical theory or from direct observation of experimental results, but an understanding of the general characteristics of the behaviour of a process is essential for intelligent investigation and implementation, whether the approach is experimental, observational, numerical or analytical. The last two have a special value since the associated costs can be relatively low and may be used as a starting point for more expensive techniques. The construction of simple models whose underlying principles are easy to see is therefore of special value, and an understanding of their strengths and limitations is essential.</P> <P>The applications considered in detail are cutting, keyhole welding, drilling, arc and hybrid laser-arc welding, hardening, cladding, forming and cutting, but the general principles have a very wide application; metallurgical aspects are considered, as are femtosecond interactions with metals. The book begins with a discussion of the mathematical formulation of some relevant classes of physical ideas, and ends with an introduction to comprehensive numerical simulation.

In general, the objective of airline schedule optimization is to find the airline schedule that maximizes operating profit. This planning task is not only the most important but also the most complex task an airline is confronted with. Until now, this task is performed by dividing the overall planning problem into smaller and less complex subproblems that are solved separately in a sequence. However, this procedure is only of minor capability to deal with interdependencies between the subproblems, resulting in less profitable schedules than those being possible with an approach solving the airline schedule optimization problem in one step. In this work, two planning approaches for integrated airline scheduling are presented. One approach follows the traditional sequential approach: existing models from literature for individual subproblems are implemented and enhanced in an overall iterative routine allowing to construct airline schedules from scratch. The other planning appraoch represents a truly simultaneous airline scheduling: using metaheuristics, airline schedules are processed and optimized at once without a separation into different optimization steps for its subproblems.</P>;<P>Presents applications of Computational Intelligence in Integrated Airline Scheduling</P>;9<HTOFPA=ijiigd>;Science

Spatial data infrastructures are growing and allow a wide number of users to rely on them. This growth has not been fully coupled to an increase of knowledge to support spatial decisions. Spatial analytical techniques, geographical analysis and modelling methods are therefore required to analyse data and to facilitate the decision process at all levels. Old geographical issues can find an answer thanks to new methods and instruments, while new issues are developing, challenging researchers towards new solutions.

The great adaptability and high yield of maize as a food, feed and forage crop have led to its production on a massive scale, with acreage expanding at the expense of other crops. Maize has developed in its non-food usage, comprising a major source of ethanol for fuel in the United States. In addition, maize has occupied center stage in the transgenic plant controversy, serving as one of the first food crops with commercialized transgenic varieties. The release of the genome sequence of maize in 2008 will indicate the structure and gene content of the first average-size plant genome and will be the most complex genome sequenced from any organism to date.</P> <P>Beyond its major agricultural and economic contributions, maize has been a model species for genetics since it was the first plant to have a genetic map, initially published by Emerson and colleagues in 1935. Such central genetic phenomena as transposable elements, nucleolar organizers, telomeres and epigenetic gene regulation were discovered first in maize, and later found to be universal eukaryotic genome properties. These key genetic contributions continue, including taking the lead in the characterization of the evolution of the highly unstable genomes so common in flowering plants.</P> <P>Among plant science researchers, maize has the second largest research community, trailing only the Arabidopsis community.

To understand the distributions of plants and animals in a landscape you need to understand how they interact with each other, and with their environment. The resulting networks of interactions make ecosystems highly complex. Recent research on complexity and artificial life provides many new insights about patterns and processes in landscapes and ecosystems. This book provides the first overview of that work for general readers. It covers such topics as connectivity, criticality, feedback, and networks, as well as their impact on the stability and predictability of ecosystem dynamics. With over 60 years of research experience of both ecology and complexity, the authors are uniquely qualified to provide a new perspective on traditional ecology. They argue that understanding ecological complexity is crucial in today’s globalized and interconnected world. Successful management of the world's ecosystems needs to combine models of ecosystem complexity with biodiversity, environmental, geographic and socioeconomic information.;<P>Combines ecology, landscapes and complexity</P> <P>Outlines a new framework for understanding complex ecological systems in landscapes</P> <P>Pitched at the general reader unlike other accounts of this area</P>;9<HTUAPI=bcdjbj>;Science

These severe physical abnormalities which are present at birth and affecting every part of the body happen more often than usually realized, once in every 33 births. The most common, after heart defects, are those of the neural tube (the brain and spinal cord) which happen in as many as one in every 350 births.

The greatest conundrum of all, which this latest matter like so much else hinges on, is the amazing fact of the tremendous, almost universal decrease in the frequency of these anomalies since early in the 20th century.

Emphasized are organization and function (especially in plants), the existence and importance of cisternal tubules, development of methods of plant and animal GA isolation and subfractionation, the concept of GA function as part of an integrated system of internal endomembranes, evidence for differentiation of membranes across the stacks of GA cisternae, and flux of membrane constituents along the polarity gradient defined by membrane differentiation all culminating in the membrane maturation or flow differentiation model of GA function. More recent contributions to GA in cell growth (enlargement) and to cancer are summarized in the final chapters.</P>;<P>Presents a historical review of Golgi Apparatus research</P> <P>Offers a summarization of the the modern era of Golgi Apparatus discovery including cell fractionation and biochemical analysis</P> <P>Focuses on molecular biology and discusses cell growth contributions</P>;9<HTLDTH=hedegc>;Science

The ELISA is still needed either alone in mass screening, such as serological assays, or used in tandem with molecular techniques to fully evaluate the molecular and antigenic nature of analytes.</P> <P>John R. Crowther provides today’s premier practical guide to the understanding and application of ELISA. This Edition enlarges on charting methods for assessing the indirect ELISA, ruggedness and robustness of tests, aspects of kit use and validation, and internal quality control and external quality management of data.

It is assumed that interspecific hybrids between members of these two groups have laid the foundation for the huge variation in cultivars as selected from the 1830’s onwards.</P> <P>Petunia thus has been a commercially important ornamental since the early days of horticulture. Despite that, Petunia was in use as a research model only parsimoniously until the late fifties of the last century. By then seed companies started to fund academic research, initially with the main aim to develop new color varieties. Besides a moment of glory around 1980 (being elected a promising model system, just prior to the Arabidopsis boom), Petunia has long been a system in the shadow. Up to the early eighties no more then five groups developed classical and biochemical genetics, almost exclusively on flower color genes. Then from the early eighties onward, interest has slowly been growing and nowadays some 20-25 academic groups around the world are using Petunia as their main model system for a variety of research purposes, while a number of smaller and larger companies are developing further new varieties.</P>;<P>Emphasis on molecular developments and on comparative issues with petunia as a model species</P> <P>The only comprehensive reference on petunia that provides an overview of the fundamentals as well as the latest research</P>;9<HTLDTH=iehjff>;Science

Possibly the most prominent sociologist in recent times, his work has touched on a myriad of topics and has influenced scholars in multiple disciplines. Throughout Bourdieu’s work, emphasis is placed on the linkage between the practice of social research and its relationship to social theory. This book honours Bourdieu’s commitment to the inextricable relationship between social theory and research in social science. In this volume, authors from all over the world utilize key concepts coined by Bourdieu, specifically his concept of capitals, habitus, and the field, and attempt to test them using quantitative survey data.</P> <P>The focus of this volume is how researchers can take key elements of Bourdieu’s work and apply them to the analysis of quantitative data on a variety of topics. Throughout the volume, issues of the possible interpretations of concepts and measurement validity are focused upon in a language that can be appreciated by new and experienced researchers alike. This volume is useful for courses where the linkage between theory and research is emphasized, at both the upper undergraduate and general postgraduate level. In addition to serving as a teaching tool, the articles within the volume will be invaluable to any scholar interested in working with Bourdieu’s concepts in quantitative research.</P>;<P>Addresses the work of Pierre Bourdieu, probably the most widely read and celebrated sociologist at the moment</P> <P>Links the problem of how to test the theories of Bourdieu with large data sets, which are becoming more widely used in the social sciences</P> <P>Addresses the issues of surrounding the validity of measuring the theoretical concepts put forward by Bourdieu</P>;9<HTMELC=ajeejb>;Science

Self-focusing in the Past: Review of Self-Focusing and Self-Trapped Filaments of Light.- Part II. Self-focusing in the Present: Self-Trapping of Optical Beams: Spatial Solitons.</P>;<P>Self-focusing has been an area of active scientific investigation for nearly 50 years. This book presents a comprehensive treatment of this topic and reviews both theoretical and experimental investigations of self-focusing. This book should be of interest to scientists and engineers working with lasers and their applications. </P> <P>From a practical point of view, self-focusing effects impose a limit on the power that can be transmitted through a material medium. Self-focusing also can reduce the threshold for the occurrence of other nonlinear optical processes. Self-focusing often leads to damage in optical materials and is a limiting factor in the design of high-power laser systems. But it can be harnessed for the design of useful devices such as optical power limiters and switches. At a formal level, the equations for self-focusing are equivalent to those describing Bose-Einstein condensates and certain aspects of plasma physics and hydrodynamics. There is thus a unifying theme between nonlinear optics and these other disciplines.</P> <P>One of the goals of this book is to connect the extensive early literature on self-focusing, filament-ation, self-trapping, and collapse with more recent studies aimed at issues such as self-focusing of fs pulses, white light generation, and the generation of filaments in air with lengths of more than 10 km. It also describes some modern advances in self-focusing theory including the influence of beam nonparaxiality on self-focusing collapse. This book consists of 24 chapters. Among them are three reprinted key landmark articles published earlier. It also contains the first publication of the 1964 paper that describes the first laboratory observation of self-focusing phenomena with photographic evidence. </P>;"<P>Enormous potential audience of professionals working with lasers and laser beam propagation in various media need knowledge about self-focusing effects</P> <P>Impressive experiments involving femtosecond self-focusing in the atmosphere and condensed matter has recently revitalized the field</P> <P>First comprehensive treatment of self-focusing; no competing book includes experimental results on important self-focusing effects such as filamentation, multifocus structure, wave collapse, etc.</P> <P>Written by the experts in the field of self-focusing</P> <P>Bridges past research on self-focusing with state-of-the-art research enabled by today's computer technology</P>";9<HTLDTH=dcbehj>;Science

In particular, it looks at relations between states and institutions that do not normally attract attention. The chapters analyze the interactions between the South and the North, consider the challenges for 'non-elite' institutions, and examine the potential for knowledge flow and creation in across-border partnerships.</P> <P>Higher education in nearly every corner of the globe is facing pressures to participate in a growing and interconnected international community of researchers, students, administrators and governmental and non-governmental organizations. Developing 'world-class' educational institutions is an admirable aim, but without grass-roots reform in other areas, such as basic education, management and leadership, it could backfire. 'Across-border' education is inevitable, but how states and institutions approach the opportunities will affect the rewards reaped.</P> <P>The editors’ aim has been to bring to the discussion the voices of experienced administrators and scholars who have been working to increase and improve the opportunities for cross-border education.

While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.</P> <P>This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression &amp; path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering.

The U.S. health care system is the largest sector in the biggest economy, and the US spends significantly more per capita on health care than any other country, yet it ranks last among comparison nations on the major health indicators. Within the U.S., there is evidence that regions that spend more do not have better outcomes, and some evidence suggests that quality of care is lower in the regions that spend more, not less, on health care.</P> <P>Robert Kaplan takes the controversial position that mass markets have been created for services that may offer little or no benefit to patients. Many of these markets are for preventive medicine, making healthy people a market for expensive pharmaceutical products and tests. These include cancer screening tests and medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose. Kaplan forcefully argues that the overuse of medications and tests runs up the costs of health care. As more employers drop health insurance for their employees when costs accelerate, the expanded use of ineffective preventive medicine may have the unintended consequence of increasing the number of uninsured patients, potentially damaging the health of others in the community.</P> <P>The concluding chapters of Disease, Diagnoses, and Dollars offer suggestions for policy makers and for patients. Methods for systematically evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new guidelines are discussed. The final chapter provides practical suggestions to enable patients to share in decisions about treatments or tests that can have uncertain benefits.</P>;<P>Controversial as it questions the foundations of preventive medicine</P> <P>Timely criticism of the health care industry and the costs of health care</P> <P>Challenges established definitions of disease, specifically in cancer, cholesterol, diabetes, obesity</P>;9<HTLDTH=heaeeh>;Trade

The great adaptability and high yields available for maize as a food, feed and forage crop have led to its current production on over 140 million hectares worldwide, with acreage continuing to grow at the expense of other crops. In terms of tons of cereal grain produced worldwide, maize has been number one for many years. Moreover, maize is expanding its contribution to non-food uses, including as a major source of ethanol as a fuel additive or fuel alternative in the US. In addition, maize has been at the center of the transgenic plant controversy, serving as the first food crop with released transgenic varieties. By 2008, maize will have its genome sequence released, providing the sequence of the first average-size plant genome (the four plant genomes that are now sequenced come from unusually tiny genomes) and of the most complex genome sequenced from any organism. </P> <P>Among plant science researchers, maize has the second largest and most productive research community, trailing only the Arabidopsis community in scale and significance.

Petri nets are one of the more promising mathematical tools for tackling deadlocks in various resource allocation systems. In a system modeled with Petri nets, siphons are tied to the occurrence of deadlock states as a structural object. The book systematically introduces the novel theory of siphons, traps, and elementary siphons of Petri nets as well as the deadlock control strategies for FMS developed from it. Deadlock prevention methods are examined comparatively. The many FMS examples presented to demonstrate the concepts and results of this book range from the simple to the complex. Importantly, to inspire and motive the reader’s interest in further research, a number of interesting and open problems in this area are proposed at the end of each chapter.</P>;<P>Gives the reader new methods for avoiding bottlenecks and interruptions in the manufacturing process, elevating efficiency and reducing costs</P> <P>Contains many real-world examples of flexible manufacturing systems from which readers may draw parallels with their own systems</P>;9<HTMIPI=iccedg>;Science

It is shown that continuous systems can undergo complex self-organization, but a need for classification of situations becomes apparent and can be seen as the evolutionary beginning of concept-based processing. Possibilities for complex self-organization are emphasized by discussion of a general principle that has been termed significance feedback, of which backpropagation of errors in neural nets is a special case.</P> <P>It is also noted that continuous measures come to be associated with processing that is essentially concept-based, as acknowledged in Marvin Minsky’s reference to heuristic connection between problems, and the associated basic learning heuristic of Minsky and Selfridge. This reappearance of continuity, along with observations on the multi-layer structure of intelligent systems, supports a potentially valuable view of intelligence as having a fractal nature. This is such that structures at a complex level, interpreted in terms of these emergent measures, reflect others at a simpler level. Implications for neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence are also examined.</P> <P>The book presents unconventional and challenging viewpoints that will be of interest to researchers in AI, psychology, cybernetics and systems science, and should help promote further research.</P>;<P>Advances an alternative approach to analyze and model intelligence</P> <P>Presents thoughts and ideas systematically</P>;9<HTLDTH=hfbgde>;Science

Cord blood is also an alternative to embryos as a source of tissue for regenerative medicine. Cells from cord blood have been shown to transdifferentiate into nonhematopoietic cells, including those of the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, bone, and cartilage, in tissue culture and in animal systems. Recently it has been demonstrated that both cardiac and glial cell differentiation of cord blood donor cells occurred in recipients of unrelated donor cord blood transplantation as part of a treatment regime for Krabbe disease and Sanfilippo syndrome.

However, in less than 50 years since its first use in the U.S. it has become one of the most popular laboratory primate species. It is larger than the other widely used monkey species, making it advantageous for many types of experiments and technological developments. It is extraordinarily hardy and highly fecund in captivity. It closely resembles humans in a variety of physiological and disease processes, such as cholesterol metabolism, early stages of atherosclerosis, and alcoholic liver disease. Its chromosomes closely resemble those of humans, and many genes of the two species lie in the same chromosomal order. Among all primates, baboons are the most widely used as models for the genetics of susceptibility to complex diseases and they are the first nonhuman primate for which a framework genetic linkage map was established. In addition, the baboon genome is currently being sequenced, and as a result the utility of this species for biomedical research will be dramatically increased. For all of these reasons, the baboon is certain to continue as one of the premier nonhuman species used in medical research.</P>;<P>First volume since 1965 to provide in depth study of Baboon in Biomedical Research</P> <P>Among all primates, baboons are the most widely used as models for the genetics of susceptibility to complex diseases and they are the first nonhuman primate for which a framework genetic linkage map was established</P> <P>In addition, the baboon genome is currently being sequenced, and as a result the utility of this species for biomedical research will be dramatically increased</P>;9<HTLDTH=hfjjag>;Science

A relevant topic in modern control theory reflecting this fact is concerned with multiobjective control problems and dynamical games. The monograph presents recent developments and applications in the field of multiobjective control of time-discrete systems with a finite set of states. The dynamics of such systems is described by a directed graph in which each vertex corresponds to a dynamic state and the edges correspond to transitions of the system moving from one state to another. This characterization allows us to formulate the considered control models on special dynamic networks. Suitable algorithms are derived exploiting multilayered structures. Game theoretical properties are characterized. A multilayered game on a network can be used to model a certain trading procedure of emission certificates within Kyoto process. Optimal economic behavior and equilibria can be determined.</P>;<P>New approach in the field of multiobjective control theory: dynamic networks and multilayered decision processes</P>;9<HTOFPA=ifaced>;Science

Endoscopy plays a pivotal role in gastroenterology and, vice versa, is crucially dependent on new developments and inventions in gastroenterology and basic sciences as well as technical progress.</P> <P>The first section deals with the most relevant new technologies including conventional and novel endoscopic imaging as well as new developments in therapeutic gastrointestinal endoscopy, pancreatobiliary endoscopy and ultrasound. The second part highlights the role of endoscopy in special areas, e.g. inflammatory bowel syndrome or pediatrics. Therapeutic endoscopy of biliary and pancreatic diseases is often difficult and involves risks. The third section contains papers on hilar tumors and chronic pancreatitis.</P> <P>Prevention and adequate management of complications is the topic of the final section. It is important to maintain high standards in interventional endoscopy. Complications can arise when patients are sedated, which is mostly the routine in daily endoscopic practice; during dilatation of gastrointestinal strictures perforations can occur or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography may result in post-interventional pancreatitis.</P>";<P>Interdisciplinary symposium bringing together basic science and clinical applications</P> <P>Up-to-date research findings at the highest scientific level</P>;9<HTMELC=ajbehg>;Science

Although understanding this triplet relationship is a key aspect of chemical education, there is considerable evidence that students find great difficulty in achieving mastery of the ideas involved. In bringing together the work of leading chemistry educators who are researching the triplet relationship at the secondary and university levels, the book discusses the learning involved, the problems that students encounter, and successful approaches to teaching.

The author presents a rather general analytical theory of exact fuzzy modeling and control of continuous and discrete-time dynamical systems. The main attention is paid to usability of the results for the control and computer engineering community and therefore simple and easy for linguistic interpretation knowledge-bases have been used. The approach is based on the author’s theorems concerning equivalence between widely used Takagi-Sugeno systems and some class of multivariate polynomials. It combines the advantages of fuzzy system theory and classical control theory. Classical control theory can be applied to modeling of dynamical plants and the controllers. They are all equivalent to the set of Takagi-Sugeno type fuzzy rules. The approach combines the best of fuzzy and conventional control theory. It enables linguistic interpretability (also called transparency) of both the plant model and the controller. In the case of linear systems and some class of nonlinear systems, the engineer can in many cases directly apply well-known classical tools from the control theory both for analysis, and the design of the closed-loop fuzzy control systems. Therefore the main objective of the book is to establish comprehensive and unified analytical foundations for fuzzy modeling using Takagi-Sugeno rule scheme and their applications for fuzzy control, identification of some class of nonlinear dynamical processes and classification problem solver design.</P>;<P>Presents mathematical analysis and rigorous design methods for fuzzy control systems based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models</P> <P>Overview about the general analytical theory of exact fuzzy modeling and control of continuous and discrete-time dynamical systems</P>;9<HTOFPA=ijjcgg>;Science

The proposed book looks at two other, equally important aspects of such space missions, and each forms half of this two part book.</P> <P></P> <P>Part 1 looks at the ways in which it is possible to exploit the focusing effect of the Sun as a gravitational lens for scientific missions to distances of 550 AU and beyond into interstellar space. The author explains the mechanism of the Sun as a gravitational lens, the scientific investigations which may be carried out along the way to a distance of 550 AU (and at the 550 AU sphere itself), the requirements for exiting the Solar System at the highest speed and a range of project ideas for missions entering interstellar space.</P> <P></P> <P>Part 2 of the book deals with the problems of communicating between an interstellar spaceship and the Earth, especially at very high speeds. Here the author assesses a range of mathematical tools relating to the Karhunen-Loève Transform (KLT) for optimal telecommunications, technical topics that may one day enable humans flying around the Galaxy to keep in contact with the Earth. This part of the book opens with a summary of the author’s 2003 Pešek Lecture presented at the IAC in Bremen, which introduces the concept of KLT for engineers and ‘newcomers’ to the subject. It is planned to include a DVD containing the full mathematical derivations of the KLT for those interested in this important mathematical tool whilst the text itself will contain the various results without outlines of the mathematical proofs. Astronautical engineers will thus be able to see the application of the results without getting bogged down in the mathematics.</P>;<P>Provides the reader with an insight into the science and technology of interstellar spaceflight as it is currently envisaged</P> <P>Examines for the first time how it may be possible to exploit the Sun as a gravitational lens for the purposes of interstellar exploration</P> <P>Investigates a key problem of interstellar flight – the telecommunications between the spacecraft and the Earth – especially at very high speeds</P> <P>Details a range of important mathematical tools relating to the Karhunen-Loève Transform for optimal telecommunications</P> <P>Allows astronautical engineers to understand the important applications of the results without becoming too involved in the mathematical proofs</P>;9<HTOFPA=hcjecg>;Science

The primary goal of THEMIS is to elucidate which magnetotail process is responsible for substorm onset at the region where substorm auroras map: (i) local disruption of the plasma sheet current (current disruption) or (ii) the interaction of the current sheet with the rapid influx of plasma emanating from reconnection.

The potential of discovery comes from the realization that alternate contexts may reveal additional valuable information. The rate at which the data is stored is growing at a phenomenal rate. As a result, traditional ad hoc mixtures of statistical techniques and data management tools are no longer adequate for analyzing this vast collection of data.

It is expected to constitute a key reference work for biologists and philosophers of biology, as well as for all scientists interested in understanding what is at stake in the present transformations of biological models and theories. The volume is distinguished by including, for the first time, self-reflections and exchanges of views on practice and theoretical attitudes by important participants in recent biological debates. The questions of how biological models and theories are constructed, how concepts are chosen and how different models can be articulated, are asked. Then the book explores some of these convergences between different models or theoretical frameworks. Confronting views on adaptive complexity are investigated, as well as the role of self-organization in evolution; niche construction meets developmental biology; the promises of the emergent field of ecological-evolutionary-development are examined. In sum, this book is a marvellous account of the dynamism of today’s theoretical biology.</P>";<P>Includes some recently discovered phenomena, such as molecular noise</P> <P>First time self reflections and exchanges of views on practice and theoretical attidues by important participants in rencent biological debates</P> <P>Key reference work for biologists and philosophers of biology</P>;9<HTMELC=ajgdfi>;Science

Some languages overtly mark some subjects, but not others, depending on certain features of the subject argument or the sentence in which the subject figures. This phenomenon is known as Differential Subject Marking (DSM). Languages differ in which conditions govern DSM. Some languages differentiate their subjects on the basis of semantic features of the argument such as thematic role, volitionality, animacy, whereas others differentiate on the basis of clausal features such as tense/aspect and the main/dependent clause distinction. DSM comes in different formal guises: case marking, agreement, inverse systems, and voice alternations.</P> <P>Relatively much is known about cross-linguistic variation in the marking of subjects, yet little attempt has been made to formalize the facts.

Alongside these iconic images lie concerns about environmental degradation, declining wildlife populations, and about worsening poverty of pastoral peoples. East Africa presents in microcosm the paradox so widely seen across sub Saharan Africa, where the world’s poorest and most vulnerable populations live alongside some of the world’s most outstanding biodiversity resources. </P> <P></P> <P>Over the last decade or so, community conservation has emerged as a way out of poverty and environmental problems for these rural populations, focusing on the sustainable use of wildlife to generate income that could underpin equally sustainable development. Given the enduring interest in East African wildlife, and the very large tourist income it generates, these communities and ecosystems seem a natural case for green development based on community conservation.</P> <P></P> <P>This volume is focused on the livelihoods of the Maasai in two different countries - Kenya and Tanzania. This cross-border comparative analysis looks at what people do, why they choose to do it, with what success and with what implications for wildlife. The comparative approach makes it possible to unpack the interaction of conservation and development, to identify the main drivers of livelihoods change and the main outcomes of wildlife conservation or other land use policies, while controlling for confounding factors in these semi-arid and perennially variable systems. This synthesis draws out lessons about the successes and failures of community conservation-based approach to development in Maasailand under different national political and economic contexts and different local social and historical particularities. </P>;<UL> <LI>First to look at community-based conservation efforts in eastern Africa</LI> <LI>Cross-border comparison aids in determining proven methods that work and don't work</LI> <LI>work is based on three decades of the community conservation effort and reported by an international group of contributors </LI></UL>;9<HTLDTH=ihejbd>;Science

The chapters illustrate the current state-of-the-art in the application of CI methods in these fields and should help and inspire researchers and practitioners to apply and develop efficient methods. A few contributions in this book are extended versions of papers presented at EvoTransLog2007: The First European Workshop on Evolutionary Computation in Transportation and Logistics which was held in Valencia, Spain, in 2007. The majority of contributions are from additional, specially selected researchers, who have done relevant work in different areas of transport, logistics, and supply chain management. The goal is to broadly cover representative applications in these fields as well as different types of solution approaches. On the application side, the contributions focus on design of traffic and transportation networks, vehicle routing, and other important aspects of supply chain management such as inventory management, lot sizing, and lot scheduling. On the method side, the contributions deal with evolutionary algorithms, local search approaches, and scatter search combined with other CI techniques such as neural networks or fuzzy approaches. The book is structured according to the application domains. Thus, it has three parts dealing with traffic and transportation networks, vehicle routing, and supply chain management.</P>;<P>Presents Advances of Computational Intelligence in Transportation and Logistics</P>;9<HTOFPA=gjacef>;Science

His book, Political Parties, first translated into English in 1954, has been very influential in both the party politics literature (which continues to make use of his typology of party organization) and in the electoral systems literature. His chief contributions there deal with what have come to be called in his honor Duverger’s Law and Duverger’s Hypothesis. The first argues that countries with plurality-based electoral methods will tend to become two-party systems; the second argues that countries using proportional representation (PR) methods will tend to become multi-party systems. Duverger also identifies specific mechanisms that will produce these effects, conventionally referred to as “mechanical effects”, and “psychological effects”. However, while Duverger’s Hypothesis concerning the link between PR and multipartism is now widely accepted; the empirical evidence that plurality voting results in two-party systems is remarkably weak—with the U.S. the most notable exception.</P> <P>The chapters in this volume consider national-level evidence for the operation of Duverger’s law in the world’s largest, longest-lived and most successful democracies of Britain, Canada, India and the United States. One set of papers involves looking at the overall evidence for Duverger’s Law in these countries; the other set deals with evidence for the mechanical and incentive effects predicted by Duverger.

We are now in a phase of unparalleled growth that is reflected by the amount of data generated from each experiment. At the time of this writing, the rate of data acquisition was approaching 2 terabytes over the course of 5 days with first pass analysis proceeding over the following 2-3 week period. This fundamental shift has provided unprecedented opportunities that for the first time afford us the ability, i.e., means, breadth, and depth of data, to truly address human biology at the systems level. This wealth of information from seemingly disparate datasets and its integration is being realized through bioinformatics. It is with this philosophy that the text Bioinformatics for Systems Biology was born. This revolution has spawned true personalized medicine that encompasses diagnostics and treatment through to cure. </P> <P>For the physical and computer scientist, this text provides an introduction to the basic biological principles governing a cell. This quickly moves from the fundamentals to exploring the underlying genetic processes. While providing a rudimentary and necessary overview for the life scientist, the physical and computer scientist will be apprised of various nuances within the field reflecting the reality of “wet-bench” science. For those in the life sciences, it is rapidly becoming appreciated that we are progressing from examining our favorite “pet” gene to the system. Statistics is now an essential component to understand the vast datasets and this is emphasized throughout the text. </P> <P>The majority of the text is devoted to the common ground that these groups share. It provides rich examples of tools, databases, and strategies to mine the databases to reveal novel insights. A host of examples of parsing the data into a series of overlays that use various presentation systems are reviewed. The goal is to provide a representation most comfortable to the user to enable the user to thoroughly explore the data. The text concludes with examples of how the systems information is used to inform personalized medicine in a true “bench to bedside” manner.</P> <P>Bioinformatics for Systems Biology bridges and unifies many disciplines. It presents the life scientist, computational biologist, and mathematician with a common framework.

But in reality, in an imprecise and uncertain environment, it will be utmost unrealistic to assume that the knowledge and representation of an expert can come in a precise way. The wider objective of the book is to study different real decision situations where problems are defined in inexact environment. Inexactness are mainly generated in two ways – (1) due to imprecise perception and knowledge of the human expert followed by vague representation of knowledge as a DM; (2) due to huge-ness and complexity of relations and data structure in the definition of the problem situation. We use interval numbers to specify inexact or imprecise or uncertain data. Consequently, the study of a decision problem requires answering the following initial questions: How should we compare and define preference ordering between two intervals?, interpret and deal inequality relations involving interval coefficients?, interpret and make way towards the goal of the decision problem? </P> <P>The present research work consists of two closely related fields: approaches towards defining a generalized preference ordering scheme for interval attributes and approaches to deal with some issues having application potential in many areas of decision making.</P>";<P>Studies real decision situations where problems are defined in inexact environment</P> <P>Presents recent research in Fuzzy Preference Ordering of Interval Numbers and Modelling of Interval Decision Problems</P>;9<HTOFPA=ijjbed>;Science

Developments in logic are especially relevant to the current situation in philosophy of science. At present, there is no single logic, single approach to semantics or well-defined conception of scientific method dominating the philosophy of science. At the same time, questions concerning linguistic, reductionist and foundationalist approaches to epistemology, the analytic and synthetic distinction as well as disputes concerning semantics and pragmatics have been illuminated by recent developments in logic. Given the power of such developments, discussions of the unity of science are even more intriguing and urgent than in the 20th century. The first title in this new series aims to explore, through extensive co-operation, new ways of achieving the integration of science in all its diversity. The present volume contains essays from some of the most important and influential philosophers in contemporary philosophy, discussing a range of topics such as philosophy of science, epistemology, philosophy of logic and game theoretical approaches. It will be of great interest to philosophers, computer scientists and all others interested in the scientific rationality.</P>;<P>Aims to explore new ways of achieving the integration of science in all its diversity</P> <P>Contains essays from some of the most important and influential philosophers in contemporary philosophy</P> <P>Discusses a range of topics such as philosophy of science, epistemology, philosophy of logic and game theoretical approaches</P>;9<HTUAPI=bceigc>;Science

Index.</P>;<P>This summary of the results of chromosomal analysis of various groups of parasitic wasps will be essential reading for those working in the field. It is the second edition of a monograph that was first published in Russian, and has been substantially updated with new data, conclusions and references.</P> <P>The goal of this ground-breaking work is to document the author’s study of the karyotype structure and chromosomal evolution of parasitic Hymenoptera. It also interprets the results obtained, from both routine and differential chromosome staining, for systematic and phylogenetic purposes.</P> <P>Despite the huge importance of parasitic wasps, many problems of their taxonomy remain insufficiently studied. This is a situation that needs rectifying, as Hymenoptera are one of the largest and most taxonomically complicated groups of insects and they play a very important role in food chains as parasitoids of the overwhelming majority of insects and other arthropods. Parasitic wasps attack many pests of agriculture and forestry as well as certain beneficial insects. In addition, some secondarily phytophagous Hymenoptera damage certain cultivated plants.</P> <P>The renowned entomologist and author of this volume, Vladimir Gokhman, has himself developed a particular technique for obtaining chromosomal preparations from adult parasitic wasps. This allowed the inclusion of a wide range of those insects into the study.</P> <P>The karyotypic features of the majority of superfamilies and families as well as many lower taxa of parasitic Hymenoptera are listed, while the plesiomorphic and apomorphic character states of chromosome sets of parasitic wasps are revealed.</P> <P>The structural features of karyotypes used for identifying and discriminating sibling species and similar forms are shown, as are the data on chromosome sets of about 400 species of parasitic Hymenoptera (including more than 200 micrographs). Also included is a comprehensive phylogenetic and taxonomic analysis of karyotypic information.</P> <P>This book is unique because it demonstrates a range of karyotypic data for an insect group that seemed unattainable in this respect not so long ago. Rich in new facts, techniques and ideas, it will be of use to all those interested in karyology and Hymenoptera.</P>;<P>The first monograph dedicated to the study of karyotype structure and chromosomal evolution of parasitic Hymenoptera</P> <P>The author had elaborated a particular technique for obtaining chromosomal preparations from adult parasitic wasps that allowed including a wide range of those insects into the karyotypic study</P> <P>Data on chromosome sets of about 400 species of parasitic Hymenoptera (including more than 200 micrographs) as well as comprehensive phylogenetic and taxonomic analyses of karyotypic information make the monograph an indispensable book for those interested in the taxonomy and genetics of the group</P>;9<HTMELC=ajiagc>;Science

A volatile area of study, in terms of the re-centering of white discourses and the appropriation of the writings of black scholars, confronting whiteness has become a controversial but potentially radical way of approaching educational issues. In this pioneering volume critical whiteness studies is applied in the United Kingdom in a variety of educational contexts. Although whiteness is considered to be a system of oppression that benefits white students and teachers in educational arenas it is not necessarily monolithic. Whiteness is flexible and inflected by class to produce new ‘whiteness(es)’ that are no less racist in intent or practice.</P> <P>Through the use of ethnographic, biographical and documentary research how whiteness ‘works’ in education is revealed. The ways in which working class whites are represented as ‘white trash’ or ‘chav’; the subtle actions of white middle class learners to reduce diversity in adult education and the pre-modern qualities of white ruling class schooling are used to highlight both divergence and congruence in the racial formation of whiteness. Policy issues are also considered, in particular the merits of regulating ‘hate speech’ in universities and the ways in which racist ‘civil defence pedagogies’ have become embedded in educational and homeland security policies.</P> <P>However, this book does not just consider the practices of whiteness but also how practitioners might consider critical whiteness studies in anti-racist practice. It is concerned with not only identifying how ‘white supremacy’ continues to dominate educational discourse and practice but how it can be resisted.</P>";<P>The first collected book which uses critical whiteness studies to examine education outside of the United States</P> <P>Uses a range of empirical techniques to interrogate whiteness within education in a number of settings (eg it moves beyond schooling)</P> <P>For those interested in ‘race’ issues in education, the book explores a new paradigm though which racism can be explored and confronted</P>;9<HTUAPI=bcdaha>;Science

This book develops a series of basic, intermediate, and more advanced models. Here the focus is on the Nash equilibrium. The key questions are: Given a shock, can policy interactions reduce the existing loss? And to what extent can they do so? Another topical issue is policy cooperation.

A number of established leaders in the field have critically summarized the recent discoveries concerning apoptosis in a particular cancer and its potential for anti-cancer treatment. The book describes how the apoptosis plays a role in the specific carcinogen-induced cellular and molecular changes during the development of the cancer, and critically discusses how the emerging anti-cancer strategy can be built by the utilization of the specific carcinogen-related apoptotic pathway.

The dual view of the latter allows for the accurate retrieval of aerosol properties over land and algorithms have been developed using these two views to eliminate the influence of the land surface reflectance on the top of the atmosphere radiation. The third chapter shows how the algorithm uses the AATSR IR and visible wavebands for cloud detection and the visible and NIR wavebands for aerosol retrieval and the consequent determination of the aerosol optical depth at various wavelengths and the dominant aerosol types. The results are then compared with independent data: sun photometers and, when available, aerosol composition.</P> <P></P> <P>Chapters 4 and 5 consider the retrieval of aerosol optical thickness and particulate matter concentration over land using MERIS and iterative aerosol retrieval technique applied to MERIS top-of-atmosphere radiance measurements. These are followed by a chapter evaluating the global aerosol properties in the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) collection 5 products. </P> <P>Chapter 7 covers the optimal estimation applied to multi-angle and multi-spectral data for the joint retrieval of the aerosol load and surface reflectance. This method provides a rigorous mathematical framework to combine satellite data, prior information on the observed system, and the modelling representation of that system. A detailed analysis of the error covariance matrix is shown together with comparisons against AERONET observations. The work is based on the analysis of METEOSAT images, which have high repetition rate and known from TV broadcasts of cloud systems by different weather services. One of aims of this book is to facilitate the introduction of chemical weather analysis (aerosols, gases, air quality indices) in the standard set of meteorological observations from a satellite. The following chapter summarizes and discusses the benefits and limitations of synergetic aerosol retrieval and its application to SCIAMACHY data while Chapter 9 looks towards an Aerosol Optical Depth</P> <P>(AOD) climatology by combining the strengths of different remote sensing techniques. The author of this chapter explains that the overall goal is to combine individual strengths of different statistics into an AOD data-set which is superior to any single AOD retrieval in accuracy as well as spatial and temporal coverage, following the concept of combining superior retrieval choices based on statistical analysis (e.g. bias, error) compared to quality references by statistics from ground sun-photometry, into single satellite retrieval composites. The book ends with a study of aerosol optical depth and air mass mapping with satellite multi-angle imaging and presents some of the latest results of the NASA Earth Observing System's Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) aerosol amount and type mapping. MISR is considered to be the best suited instrument for satellite aerosol research at the moment (at least for cloud free conditions).

The theory is based on a novel analysis of reliable belief-formation that answers classic objections to reliability theories in epistemology. The analysis generates a way of distinguishing justified belief from believing justifiedly, such that inerrant belief-formation need not be justificatory whereas systemic deception could be. It thereby respects the intuition that standards for justification must be accessible to the believer, while maintaining the essential connection of justification to truth.</P> <P>The analysis shows how justification relates to, but is distinct from, evidence, rationality, and probability.

Recommender systems automatically generate product recommendations: customers profit from a faster finding of relevant products, stores profit from rising sales. All aspects of recommender systems are covered: the economic background, mechanism design, a survey of systems in the Internet, statistical methods and algorithms, service oriented architectures, user interfaces, as well as experiences and data from real-world applications. Specific solutions for areas with strong privacy concerns, scalability issues for large collections of products, as well as algorithms to lessen the cold-start problem for a faster return on investment of recommender projects are addressed. This book describes all steps it takes to design, implement, and successfully operate a recommender system for a specific information platform.</P>;;9<HTOHUA=icbddi>;Science

Conclusion. References. Index.</P>;<P>Hydrodynamic equations well describe averaged parameters of turbulent steady flows, at least in pipes where boundary conditions can be estimated. The equations might outline the parameters fluctuations as well, if entry conditions at current boundaries were known. This raises, in addition, the more comprehensive problem of the primary perturbation nature, noted by H.A. Lorentz, which still remains unsolved. Generally, any flow steadiness should be supported by pressure waves emitted by some external source, e.g. a piston or a receiver. The wave plane front in channels quickly takes convex configuration owing to Rayleigh's law of diffraction divergence. The Schlieren technique and pressure wave registration were employed to investigate the wave interaction with boundary layer, while reflecting from the channel wall. The reflection induces boundary-layer local separation and following pressure rapid increase within the perturbation zone. It propagates as an acoustic wave packet of spherical shape, bearing oscillations of hydrodynamic parameters. Superposition of such packets forms a spatio-temporal field of oscillations fading as 1/r. This implies a mechanism of the turbulence. Vorticity existing in the boundary layer does not penetrate in itself into potential main stream. But the wave leaving the boundary layer carries away some part of fluid along with frozen-in vorticity. The vorticity eddies form another field of oscillations fading as 1/r<SUP>2</SUP>. This implies a second mechanism of turbulence. Thereupon the oscillation spatio-temporal field and its randomization development are easy computed. Also, normal burning transition into detonation is explained, and the turbulence inverse problem is set and solved as applied to plasma channels created by laser Besselian beams.</P>;<P>Origin of primary perturbation in turbulent flows.

Was bleibt übrig, wenn man alle Materie wegnimmt? Kann es einen wirklich leeren Raum geben – oder ist Nichts unmöglich? Dieses kleine Buch erkundet die Wissenschaft und die Geschichte der schwer fassbaren „Leere' – von Aristoteles, der darauf bestand, dass ein Vakuum nicht möglich sei, über die Theorien Newtons und Einsteins bis zu den spannenden Entdeckungen der jüngsten Vergangenheit, die uns Außergewöhnliches über den Kosmos verraten. Der angesehene britische Physiker Frank Close erzählt die Geschichte der Forscher, die sich auf die Suche nach dem Vakuum begeben haben, und ihrer oft kontroversen Befunde. Sein Bericht führt uns von den Ideen der Antike und manchem kulturell geprägten Aberglauben zur vordersten Front der Astrophysik und Kosmologie. Wir erfahren, wie die Wissenschaftler herausfanden, dass das Vakuum von Feldern erfüllt ist, wie sich Newton, Mach und Einstein mit der Natur von Raum und Zeit auseinandersetzten und wie der mysteriöse „Äther', der einstmals den leeren Raum erfüllen sollte, heute in der Erforschung des „Higgs-Feldes' ein Comeback zu feiern scheint. Das Vakuum – so viel wissen wir inzwischen – ist alles Andere als „Nichts': Es wimmelt dort von virtuellen Teilchen und Antiteilchen, die spontan und abrupt reale Gestalt annehmen, und es scheint versteckte Dimensionen zu umfassen, von denen wir bisher nichts ahnten. Diese neuen Entdeckungen können uns womöglich Antworten auf eine der grundlegenden Fragen der Kosmologie geben: Was befindet sich außerhalb des Universums? Und wie konnte das Universum überhaupt entstehen, wenn es davor nichts gab?</P>;;9<HTOINH=ecajfe>;Sachbuch

The book focuses on distributed leadership and focuses on the emerging evidence about the possibilities and shortcomings of this form of leadership. The book will draw upon the latest empirical findings from studies in different countries that have focused on the relationship between distributed forms of leadership and organisational change. The main aim of the book is to offer contemporary, comparative and challenging accounts of distributed leadership practice.</P> <P>This book outlines current understandings, findings and limitations of the concept of distributed leadership. It brings together different international perspectives on distributed leadership as well as looking at distributed leadership through three major lenses–the empirical, the interpretive and the critical.</P> <P>The book aims to offer challenge, debate and critique, as well as presenting the latest empirical findings about the impact and effects of distributed leadership on organizational change.

The task of computerized data clustering has been approached from diverse domains of knowledge like graph theory, multivariate analysis, neural networks, fuzzy set theory, and so on. Clustering is often described as an unsupervised learning method but most of the traditional algorithms require a prior specification of the number of clusters in the data for guiding the partitioning process, thus making it not completely unsupervised. Modern data mining tools that predict future trends and behaviors for allowing businesses to make proactive and knowledge-driven decisions, demand fast and fully automatic clustering of very large datasets with minimal or no user intervention. </P> <P>In this volume, we formulate clustering as an optimization problem, where the best partitioning of a given dataset is achieved by minimizing/maximizing one (single-objective clustering) or more (multi-objective clustering) objective functions. Using several real world applications, we illustrate the performance of several metaheuristics, particularly the Differential Evolution algorithm when applied to both single and multi-objective clustering problems, where the number of clusters is not known beforehand and must be determined on the run. This volume comprises of 7 chapters including an introductory chapter giving the fundamental definitions and the last Chapter provides some important research challenges.</P> <P>Academics, scientists as well as engineers engaged in research, development and application of optimization techniques and data mining will find the comprehensive coverage of this book invaluable.</P>;<P>Latest research on metaheuristic clustering</P>;9<HTOFPA=jcbhcb>;Science

The harmonious symbiosis of the engineering approach and the accurate scientific methodology features the aspects of highly relevant and practical design principles governing the development of EHW and its connections with AS/AH.

The interactive effects of rationality and expectation are examined around belief, prospect, time and conditions of belief justification where the relationship between possibility and probability as a sequential link between potential and actual is analyzed to provide some understanding of the role of relative costs and benefits in defining risk in both nature and society. The concepts of possibilistic and probabilistic beliefs are explicated in relation to rationality and the decision-choice process where the analytical relationship between uncertainty and expectation formation is presented leading to the introduction of two types of uncertainty composed of fuzzy uncertainty and stochastic uncertainty.</P>;<P>Develops an epistemic framework for understanding fuzzy paradigm and fuzzy optimal decision-choice rationality</P> <P>Focuses on unified epistemic models of decision-choice processes</P>;9<HTOFPA=iiaigi>;Science

The broad sweep takes in key historical and contemporary figures and their influences on drama education practice, including the ‘speech and drama’ movement, drama- and theatre-in-education, drama therapy and psychodrama, and emergent forms such as Applied Theatre. In its journey through play in the early years to the play on the stage, the book identifies and explains drama’s four paradigms of purpose: for language, for development, as pedagogy and as art-form. It shows how these interweave in highly intricate ways to provide different kinds of learning for different contexts, and how they sometimes become tangled in practice and theory, in the constant efforts of drama and theatre practitioners to get drama established in the curriculum, and keep it there.</P>;"<P>The only one to provide a global view of the development of drama curriculum</P> <P>The only text that links the fields of drama, curriculum, drama and language learning, and applied theatre </P> <P>Teases out comprehensively and authoritatively the significant influences and constraints in the history of drama and schooling</P> <P>Provides important case studies of 1) systemic curriculum development; 2) the enacted curriculum </P> <P>Analyses thoroughly the internecine connections and resolves the key battles and conflicts within the field</P>";9<HTMELC=ajdgjc>;Science

These systems provide scientists with a degree of experimental control that is not achievable through field experiments. Yet to date, techniques for systematically extrapolating results from small-scale experimental ecosystems to larger, deeper, more open, more biologically diverse, and more heterogeneous ecosystems in nature have not been well developed.

Although the topic of business process management using information technology has been addressed by consultants and software developers in depth, more fundamental approaches towards such Process-Aware Information Systems (PAISs) have been rather uncommon. It wasn't until the 1990s that researchers started to work on the foundations of PAISs. Clearly, concurrency theory is an essential ingredient in these foundations as business processes are highly concurrent involving all types of routing logic and resource allocation mechanisms. The 16 papers in this special issue of ToPNoC cover topics ranging from the formal (mostly Petri-net based) foundations of PAISs to more applied topics such as flexibility and process mining. Thus, this volume gives a good overview of the state of the art in PAIS research.</P>;;9<HTOGPC=aaijig>;Science

After a critical assessment of various contemporary theories of law is provided, a new theory of legal interpretation is set forth and defended. The respective words of Immanuel Kant and H. L. A. Hart on the possibility and desirability of international law are carefully explicated. Following this, <EM>Race, Rights, and Justice</EM> defends John Rawls' Law of Peoples from the cosmopolitan liberal critique of it. The nature and importance of rights, both individual and collective, are clarified while correcting some political philosophies that have propagated confused rhetoric about rights. And the collective right to humanitarian intervention is investigated philosophically in terms of the recent problems in Colombia, with surprisingly original results. While the methodology of this book is thoroughly analytical, philosophically speaking, some of the conclusions drawn are substantially original, infusing the facts of race and racism into mainstream matters of philosophy of law.<BR></P> <P>'In this collection of essays, J.

There is already severe scarcity in many regions of the world, causing tremendous problems for local populations and indeed entire societies. There is insufficient water available for the production of food to alleviate poverty and starvation; the lack of water hampers industrial, urban and tourism development, forcing restrictions on other sectors, especially agriculture; health problems arise as the deterioration of ground and surface waters favours water-borne diseases, which flourish in the absence of decent water distribution and sewerage systems. Water conflicts still arise in areas under stress, while water for nature has become a vanishing priority in such zones.</P> <P></P> <P>This book is a guide to the establishment of regional and/or local guidelines for developing and implementing new ideas for coping with water scarcity. The basic premise underlying the book is that water scarcity will persist, so personal, human and society-wide skills will be needed to cope with it while living in harmony with the necessary environmental constraints. The book provides basic information to assist decision makers, water managers, engineers, agronomists, social scientists and other professions (and their students) in formulating coherent, hopefully harmonious and consolidated views on the issue.

Pompidou: Valorization of Knowledge - A Key to Success.;<P>The subprime crisis and the general crisis of the global financial system in 2008 not only put the globalization process and all that it involves under extreme pressure, but, at least for some, it called the entire system into question. What in spring had seemed unthinkable, at least for those who had ignored Paul Krugman's blogs, suddenly and without warning became hard reality.</P> <P>A credo of today's prominent leaders is that thoroughly considered and internationally effective regulation is needed to address almost all current global challenges, whether they concern global warming, human rights and migration, or international finance. Such regulatory systems will have to pay attention to ethics and morals, which is something that the present collapsed system has failed to do.</P> <P>This book provides insight into the functioning of the global economy, the roots of the present international financial crisis and the responses of highly distinguished politicians, industrialists and academics.</P>;;9<HTOFPA=jcgiab>;Science

Our assumption is that, as a result of quality assurance activities, practitioners obtain information about their own functioning and institutional performance which is new and valuable to them and which therefore will form a basis for them to improve performance. This assumption proves to be naïve; too often performance feedback is under-utilized, and evaluations become void, legitimizing rites instead of a basis for organizational learning and the improvement of institutions. </P> <P>The aim of this book was to find out when educational institutions do transform Quality Assurance data into actions to improve performance, and how the use of such data can be promoted. This volume reports on the study of Quality Assurance structures and activities in 36 educational institutes in 6 European Countries and presents guidelines for Quality Assurance.</P>";<P>Points to the problem of under-utilized Quality assurance data instead of the wishful thinking about Quality Assurance in education</P> <P>Discusses Quality assurance processes in six European countries to find the critical success factors for utilizing Quality assurance data</P> <P>Provides guidelines for Quality assurance that have been formulated and tested in schools</P>;9<HTMELC=ajfcgj>;Science
